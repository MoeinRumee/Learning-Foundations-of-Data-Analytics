## Module 4
In this self-reflection, you’ll consider the businesses you interact with day-to-day and reflect on how they use data to improve their customer experience. 
Pick a company, service, or product that you've had personal experience with that uses data to improve its customer service. Some examples are local restaurants, health care providers, internet providers, or your favorite smartphone app. 
Then, think of a specific customer experience problem this company, service or product might have that you suspect could be addressed with data. This could be something like a restaurant tracking sales of a new product, or internet service providers trying to figure out where outages occur. 
Try to avoid broad problems and think of specific issues. A good example of a problem would be that the meal you ordered from a delivery service arrived cold. 
Consider the company, service, or product you chose in this reflection: 
- How could it use data to improve customer experience?
- What kinds of data would it need to collect?
- How could insights from that data solve a problem?
Now, write 2-3 sentences (40-60 words) in response to each of these questions.

I’ll use Starbucks as the example:

Starbucks could utilize data to minimize long wait times during peak hours by forecasting demand and adjusting staffing levels accordingly. This would improve efficiency and ensure customers receive their orders faster.

They would need to collect transaction timestamps, order details, store traffic patterns, and mobile order frequency to understand customer flow and demand surges throughout the day.

By analyzing this data, Starbucks could forecast high-demand periods, prepare popular drinks in advance, and schedule staff more effectively, reducing wait times and ensuring customers consistently receive fresh, timely orders.
